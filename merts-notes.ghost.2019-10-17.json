from a couple of weeks ago, I have been thinking to create my own blog to share my experiences, thoughts and ingishts about tech – and other stuff. We'll see how it will go!\\n\\nThere are many ready-to-go blogging software (i.e. WordPress, Joomla etc.). However, I was searching for something different — maybe something more modern and elegant.\\n\\nI came up with [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). Ghost is a publishing platform used by many well-known websites around the world such as Mozilla, DuckDuckGo, Airtable, CodeAcademy, Sky News and many more. What hit me about Ghost in the first place is its design. It is clean, well-organized and easy-to-read.\\n\\nGhost has free and paid version. In the paid version — also known as GhostPro — your blog is hosted in Ghost's servers. However, the free version is also available and but you have to host it your own. In this article, I will explain the steps that I followed to create this blog.\\n\\nThis blog is fully dockerized (i.e. created with docker container). There are three docker images used:\\n\\n1. NGINX \\n2. Let's Encrypt\\n3. Ghost\\n\\nI used NGINX for [reverse-proxy](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/). For those who never heard reverse-proxy, it is quite simple technology which send requests to web servers. Let's say you have multiple service in your machine (e.g. WordPress, Joomla, and Ghost), the reverse-proxy looks at the request and sends the client to the right service.\\n\\nLet's Encrypt is another initiative sponsored by big companies such as Facebook, Google and Mozilla. They provide free SSL certificates. Instead of paying hundres of bucks for a simple SSL certificate, they give free for you!\\n\\nFor all the docker containers I used docker-compose which is a tool to run multiple docker containers and manage them from a single file.\\n\\nMy design is quite simple: I created a folder called nginx.
